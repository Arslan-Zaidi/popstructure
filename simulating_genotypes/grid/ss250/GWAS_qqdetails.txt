details of method to generate genotypes for the grid model (250 samples/deme), carry out GWAS on non-genetic phenotype and generate qqplots

1. Generate genotype data for the grid model:


script used: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/msprime2plink_1.sh
  - uses: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/generate_genos_grid.py

output: 20 vcf and plink .bed files (each representing genotypes from a chromosome of 10Mb):
  - output location: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau${tau}/ss250/
  - output format: genos_grid_d36_m${m}_s250_t${tau}_chr${i}.vcf/bim/bed/fam

2. Process genotypes:

goal: format plink .bim files to give SNPs IDs (chr:position), then merges the individual chromosomes into a single file

script used: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/proc_genotypes_2.sh

output: 1 single plink-formatted genotype file
  - output location: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau${tau}/ss250/
  - output format: genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s250_t100_gl200.bim/bed/fam/afreq

3. simulate phenotype for GWAS:

script used: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/simphenotype_grid_3.R

output: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/phenotypes/grid_d36_s250_e${e_sd}.pheno

4. PCA_grid_4.sh:

goal: carry out common and rare PCA on simulated genotypes

script used: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/PCA_grid_4.sh

output: *.eigenvec and *.eigenval files
  - output location: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau${tau}/ss250
  - output format: genos_grid_d36_m${m}_s250_t${tau}_gl200.${freq}.ldpruned.eigenvec

5. Carry out association test (fixed effects):

script used: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/plink_assoc_6.sh

output: *.glm.linear files for each phenotype
  - output location: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/gwas_results/tau${tau}/e2
  - output format: gwas_grid_d36_m${m}_s250_t${tau}_gl200_e2_${freq}.pcs100.all.${pheno}.glm.linear

Note: there are many other *glm.linear files in this folder which were GWAS carried out earlier but did not make it into the manuscript. Ok to remove these probably to avoid clutter
