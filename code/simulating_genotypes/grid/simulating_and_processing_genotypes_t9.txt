Details of scripts used to simulate genotypes in a grid model with 500 individuals per deme.
(3 independent sets): 250/deme for GWAS, 250/deme for PRS prediction

location of data and output gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau-9

Step 1: generate genotypes, write to vcf file for each chromosome separately

script used: popstruct_scripts/simulating_genotypes/grid/tau-9/generate_genos_gridt9_wrapper.sh

    a. generate genotypes for 18,000 individuals (500/deme for 36 demes)

      - script used: popstruct_scripts/simulating_genotypes/grid/generate_genos_grid.py

    b. Msprime does not print variant ID in vcf file. Add these to vcf files using bcftools (fmt: CHR_POS_REF_ALT)

Step 2: Convert vcf file to pgen files

script used: popstruct_scripts/simulating_genotypes/grid/tau-9/vcf2plink_t9.sh

    a. Merge individual chromosome files into one

    b. Convert merged vcf file to pgen file

    c. Split into training (GWAS) and test (PRS prediction) sets
        Note: msprime converts genomic coordinates which are not integers to integers when outputting vcf files.
        This creates duplicated position. I removed duplicated positions to simplify downstream analyses

Step 3: Generate principal components from genotype data

script used: popstruct_scripts/simulating_genotypes/grid/tau-9/pca_t9.sh

    a. Write list of common (MAF>5%) and rare variants (MAC=2,3,4) to file

    b. Sample 200k common variants and 1M rare variants and carry out PCA

    c. calculate allele frequency for common and rare variants

output file location(s):
-gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau-9/ss500/genotypes
-gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau-9/ss500/train/
