Details for carrying out GWAS with nongenetic and genetic effects on the training sample and PRS prediction in test.

working directory: gwas_bias2/gwas/grid/genotypes/tau100/ss500/

1. Select 2000 'causal' variants uniformly at random 100kb apart

  - command: plink2
      --bp-space 100000 \
      --mac 1 \
      --make-pgen \
      --out train/genotypes/genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100.rmdup.train.thinned_100kb \
      --pfile train/genotypes/genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100.rmdup.train

  - output: genotypes/genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100.rmdup.train.thinned_100kb.pgen/pvar/psam

2. Calculate frequency for these variants in the sample - this is going to be used to generate effect sizes

   - command: plink2 --freq \
      --out frequencies/genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100.rmdup.train.thinned_100kb.frq \
      --pfile genotypes/genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100.rmdup.train.thinned_100kb

3. generate effect sizes for causal variants (in separate .rmd file) and phenotypes (genetic + random, genetic + smooth, genetic + sharp)

  - output 1: train/ genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100.rmdup.train.thinned_100kb.effects

  - output 2: genos_grid_d36_m0.05_s500_t100_gl200_thinned_100kb.wtge.pheno3


4. carry out fixed_effects  GWAS on these phenotypes

  - script: gwas_ge.sh

  - output: train/gwas_results/fixed_effects/ge/gwas.train.pheno3.${freq}.${phenotype}.glm.linear

5. Take the estimated effect sizes from these GWAS and construct PRS using different methods of ascertaining 'significant' hits:

  - script for SNP ascertainment: in an .RMD file
  - output_dir: train/betas/*.betas

  - script for calculating PRS: test/cal_prs.sh
  - output: test/*.sscore
